## Enterprise Information Technology is about to get caught with it’s pants down.

> The New Office looks a lot like the Old Office except you don’t get any points for ‘looking’ busy.

There was a time when enterprise profit centers had no real choice but to rely on their internal information technology departments. Projects took 3 months just to clear to the hurdles of resource allocation and change management. That time was 2019.

In 2020, [58% of knowledge workers are now working remotely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/03/20/58-of-american-knowledge-workers-are-now-working-remotely/#32f5529d3303) and that’s only the beginning of the sea change.

For the last 15 years the single biggest strategic decision point in corporate IT was ‘on shoring’ versus ‘off shoring’. In a world where the vast majority of knowledge workers are working remotely, there is no difference between ‘onshore’ and ‘offshore’. That’s an old mindset that just went the way of the dodo bird.

The Dodo Bird, The Giant Ground Sloth, [The Eastman Kodak Company](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-lands-765-million-u-s-loan-in-start-of-medical-supply-chain-fix-11595930400?mod=hp_lead_pos3). There is a certain kind of organism that manages to thrive in isolation, yet completely collapses in the face of competition and predation. The world is about to come to grips with the reality that the vast majority of enterprise information technology departments fall into this category.

Imagine a world where delivery matters. Where execution matters. Where profit centers contract directly with streamlined efficient providers whos only way to survive is their ability to deliver… on spec, on time, on budget.
