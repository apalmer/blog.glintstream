# Foundation of Execution

On the startup side of the industry, the most commonly _talked_ about business strategies revolve around __**Disruption**__. But, for my money no one has ever put it as eloquently as the young brooklyn kid who _actually_ disrupted his field with brutal efficiency.
> Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth **- Mike Tyson**

On the other side of the software game, in the Enterprise, equally cliche is the oft stated strategy of __**Agility**__.  I think the famous slightly sped up clip of a 19 year old Mike Tyson going through his paces during a training session makes the point better than any words ever could: Mike knows Agility too.

### Neither Disruption or Agility are strategies. ### 

Disruption is an outcome. Agility is a resource. A strategy is the focused forward looking plan followed with driving dedictation, and implementated with unrelenting discipline in persuit of a long term goal that enables even longer term goals.  

In the case of Mike Tyson, the strategy was the regime of training, the endless cardio, the expert selection of the most efficient and powerful movements, the grinding repetition to encode these movements in muscle memory. This is how one aquires Agility. 

A lifetime of study of the fundamentals of the sweet science, the accurate assessment of opponents weakness, relentless destruction of ones own weaknesses resulting in impregnible defence, the absolute mastery of psychological warfare, and the relentless training necessary to build that world famous and world shattering power. That is how Disruption is actualized.

### Understanding what is and isn't a strategy is probably the first step in actually implementing one. ###

As with anything, the study of the history is the most likely the best way to predict the future.  The seminal [Strategy: A History](https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-Lawrence-Freedman-audiobook/dp/B00KMZX8Y8/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1597023740&sr=8-1) maybe too much of a tome for casual reading, but in audio book format is an engaging and entertaining primer on the matter. 

From the perspective of Information Technology in particular, I keep going back to the fundamentals of [Enterprise Architecture As Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution](https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Architecture-Strategy-Foundation-Execution/dp/1591398398/ref=asc_df_1591398398/?tag=bingshoppinga-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=&hvpos=&hvnetw=o&hvrand=&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4584345016330842&psc=1). This blog owes a lot of its fundations to the theories exposed by this book.
