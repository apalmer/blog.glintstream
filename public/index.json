That\u0026rsquo;s a good question, as there seems to be a wide range of answers. However the basic idea started with previous years\u0026rsquo; Gartner darling, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which is essentially the application of small simple rule based programs which can automate repetative work. Now, imagine if you could apply RPA to all your low level business processes? Not only is the repetative work automated but beyond that now every single process and/or transaction can also be captured as a digital event and the structured data associated with that event. This event could be analyzed by a digital \u0026lsquo;brain\u0026rsquo; that could then apply logic of arbitrary complexity and automatically trigger other business events without human intervention or with human approval if required. Rich workflows could be created to orchestrate complex interactions between dozens of disparate business processes via these events. On top of this layer of transactional automated business processing, machine learning algorithms can analyze the raw business event stream to generate new insights into what makes your business tick, and provide N-dimensional reporting and forecasting in realtime for human consumption. Furthermore this stream of digital events and the complex interactions between the constituent parts could be thought of as a Digital Twin that exactly maps to your real world business. Modern day Artificial Intelligence could analyze this Digital Twin, unearth relationships between component business processes beyond human intuition, apply a wide range of cutting edge optimiztion algorithms, run millions of simulations of what would happen to your real world business if a given change is made, select the best outcomes ranked along any chosen weighting criteria, and then provide recommendations for C-level executives along with the data to back it up.\nLet me be clear this is not science fiction, this is not a pipe dream, this is not just hype and buzzword bingo. However this is also not new to 2020, in any shape, form, or fashion. This is the self same \u0026lsquo;digitial transformation\u0026rsquo; that has been chased for almost 2 decades at this point. The main difference between this year\u0026rsquo;s take on \u0026lsquo;digital transformation\u0026rsquo; and the previous years\u0026rsquo;, if there is one, is the idea that the transformation starts at the leaf nodes. It starts at the low level business processes being taken over by RPA. There is a certain compelling rationality to this.\nInstead of going for the incredibly complex migration to a new multi-multimillion dollar CRM or ERP platform, building out a risky (Micro)Service Oriented Architecture that might never actually see adoption across your enterprise even if successfully developed, or any of the other big bang top down approaches to digital transformation why not go at it from the opposite direction? Start with digitizing the dozens or even hundreds of simple processes that make up your business with RPA. Each individual automation of a single business process is a relatively small but concrete win that provides immediate real world bottomline value to the business. The best thing about this approach is you can afford to fail on a given automation attempt, still reap the benefits from your other successful automation attempts, get up, dust your knees off and try again. Once you have completed this leaf-node automation phase, proven your capability and aquired digital transformation competence, then take on the more complex components. Honestly this is just the proven industry standard iterative development philosophy writ large.\nSo from that perspective, i am excited to see how this strategy plays out in the real world.\n  ","permalink":"/blog/hyperautomation/","tags":["Business"],"title":"HyperAutomation"},{"categories":["square-biz"],"contents":"Foundation of Execution On the startup side of the industry, the most commonly talked about business strategies revolve around Disruption. But, for my money no one has ever put it as eloquently as the young brooklyn kid who actually disrupted his field with brutal efficiency.\n Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth - Mike Tyson\n On the other side of the software game, in the Enterprise, equally cliche is the oft stated strategy of Agility. I think the famous slightly sped up clip of a 19 year old Mike Tyson going through his paces during a training session makes the point better than any words ever could: Mike knows Agility too.\nNeither Disruption or Agility are strategies. Disruption is an outcome. Agility is a resource. A strategy is the focused forward looking plan followed with driving dedictation, and implementated with unrelenting discipline in persuit of a long term goal that enables even longer term goals.\nIn the case of Mike Tyson, the strategy was the regime of training, the endless cardio, the expert selection of the most efficient and powerful movements, the grinding repetition to encode these movements in muscle memory. This is how one aquires Agility.\nA lifetime of study of the fundamentals of the sweet science, the accurate assessment of opponents weakness, relentless destruction of ones own weaknesses resulting in impregnible defence, the absolute mastery of psychological warfare, and the relentless training necessary to build that world famous and world shattering power. That is how Disruption is actualized.\nUnderstanding what is and isn\u0026rsquo;t a strategy is probably the first step in actually implementing one. As with anything, the study of the history is the most likely the best way to predict the future. The seminal Strategy: A History maybe too much of a tome for casual reading, but in audio book format is an engaging and entertaining primer on the matter.\nFrom the perspective of the Enterprise and it\u0026rsquo;s love/hate relationship with Information Technology in particular, I keep going back to the fundamentals of Enterprise Architecture As Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution. This blog owes a lot of its fundations to the theories exposed by this book.\nStrategic Technology Trends for 2020  Through the lights, camera, action, glamour, glitter and gold, I unfold the scroll\n Enterprise Information Technology\u0026rsquo;s favorite problematic bae has released Gartner Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2020. One cannot escape the logical incongruence of the term \u0026lsquo;strategy\u0026rsquo; being applied to the term \u0026lsquo;trend\u0026rsquo;, fundamentally if your IT strategy changes every 12 months you have no strategy. Also, opinion\u0026rsquo;s on Gartner vary, and vary, and vary. Regardless of what you feel about Gartner as a business entity, the reliability of their analysis, or their outsized impact on the hype cycle, they unequivocally are thought leaders that the majority of CIO\u0026rsquo;s turn to for guidance. Understanding the influences on those who control the purse strings is never a bad bet in any business related strategy, so in the next couple blog posts I am going to dive into what I think are the most interesting of Gartner\u0026rsquo;s top 10.\nRead more about\u0026hellip; HyperAutomation  Read more about\u0026hellip; Democratization In the best of times any real world competitive strategy has to take into account imperfect information, and 2020 in particular may be the blackest swan on record.

The New Office looks a lot like the Old Office except you don’t get any points for ‘looking’ busy.\n There was a time when enterprise profit centers had no real choice but to rely on their internal information technology departments.
