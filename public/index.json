[{"categories":["square-biz"],"contents":"Foundation of Execution On the startup side of the industry, the most commonly talked about business strategies revolve around Disruption. But, for my money no one has ever put it as eloquently as the young brooklyn kid who actually disrupted his field with brutal efficiency.\n Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth - Mike Tyson\n On the other side of the software game, in the Enterprise, equally cliche is the oft stated strategy of Agility. I think the famous slightly sped up clip of a 19 year old Mike Tyson going through his paces during a training session makes the point better than any words ever could: Mike knows Agility too.\nNeither Disruption or Agility are strategies. Disruption is an outcome. Agility is a resource. A strategy is the focused forward looking plan followed with driving dedictation, and implementated with unrelenting discipline in persuit of a long term goal that enables even longer term goals.\nIn the case of Mike Tyson, the strategy was the regime of training, the endless cardio, the expert selection of the most efficient and powerful movements, the grinding repetition to encode these movements in muscle memory. This is how one aquires Agility.\nA lifetime of study of the fundamentals of the sweet science, the accurate assessment of opponents weakness, relentless destruction of ones own weaknesses resulting in impregnible defence, the absolute mastery of psychological warfare, and the relentless training necessary to build that world famous and world shattering power. That is how Disruption is actualized.\nUnderstanding what is and isn\u0026rsquo;t a strategy is probably the first step in actually implementing one. As with anything, the study of the history is the most likely the best way to predict the future. The seminal Strategy: A History maybe too much of a tome for casual reading, but in audio book format is an engaging and entertaining primer on the matter.\nFrom the perspective of Information Technology in particular, I keep going back to the fundamentals of Enterprise Architecture As Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution. This blog owes a lot of its fundations to the theories exposed by this book.\nStrategic Technology Trends for 2020  From the Womb to the Tomb, Presume the Unpredictable - Nasir Jones\n Gartner Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2020\nHyperAutomation Democratization   ","permalink":"/blog/strategic-foci/","tags":["Business"],"title":"Strategic Foci"},{"categories":["square-biz"],"contents":"Enterprise Information Technology is about to get caught with it’s pants down.  The New Office looks a lot like the Old Office except you don’t get any points for ‘looking’ busy.\n There was a time when enterprise profit centers had no real choice but to rely on their internal information technology departments. Projects took 3 months just to clear to the hurdles of resource allocation and change management. That time was 2019.\nIn 2020, 58% of knowledge workers are now working remotely and that’s only the beginning of the sea change.\nFor the last 15 years the single biggest strategic decision point in corporate IT was ‘on shoring’ versus ‘off shoring’. In a world where the vast majority of knowledge workers are working remotely, there is no difference between ‘onshore’ and ‘offshore’. That’s an old mindset that just went the way of the dodo bird.\nTwo Words: Managed Services  There’s a war going on outside no man is safe from. You can run but you can’t hide forever.\n   The Dodo Bird, The Giant Ground Sloth, The Eastman Kodak Company. There is a certain kind of organism that manages to thrive in isolation, yet completely collapses in the face of competition and predation. The world is about to come to grips with the reality that the vast majority of enterprise information technology departments fall into this category.\nImagine a world where delivery matters. Where execution matters. Where profit centers contract directly with streamlined efficient providers whos only way to survive is their ability to deliver… on spec, on time, on budget.\nSurvival of the fit.
